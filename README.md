                width: 20rem;
                background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);
            }
            
            .title{
                
                text-align: center;
                font-size: 23px;
                
            }

            .attribution {

                font-size: 12px;
            }

        }

## 🔍 What I'd Do Differently

If I revisit or scale this project, I would:

- Add light animations (e.g., hover effects for interactivity)
- Explore using CSS Grid as an alternative layout method
- Implement a dark mode toggle for better user accessibility
- Add basic accessibility features like `aria-labels` for screen readers
